This is a Unity game I built during University for the task of finding a niche concept and implementing a polished viable product from start to finish. This game is a simple 2D shooting fighter game where a player is given 6 bullets, with 3 having an unknown unique effect. The unique effects are picked from the same pool for both players every match, so they will have different effects and will have to adapt accordingly. Each unique bullet is shot in the order of the revolving cylinder shown in the HUD, and display the unique effect once it has been fired once.
